# 3d-Cellular-Automata

You will need SFML and OpenGL set up to run this program. The provided makefile makes reference to a C:\WinCPP\... directory. This is where I keep everything that needs to be included/linked for the compilation. Your environment will likely differ.

This project is a 3d visualization of 3d celular automata, specifically, Conway's Game of Life (famous) automata. The rules can be changed such that it makes more sense in 3d space.
